Advent of Code - 2020
=====================

This repo contains my solutions for the
[AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles.


**/!\ WARNING /!\\: These are quick and dirty solutions! Do NOT expect readable
variable names, nor proper coding practices, nor meaningful comments!!**

**Also mind that here, in Europe, we either have to get up at 6 AM or go to bed
at 8 AM in order to be somewhere in the low ranking (<2000). So sleep
deprivated coding is far from the best**
